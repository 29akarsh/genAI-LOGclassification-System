# genAI-LOGclassification-System
This project showcases a production-ready approach to system monitoring, combining the speed of Machine Learning with the intelligence of Generative AI.


The Dual-Engine Approach

ML Speed (NaÃ¯ve Bayes): A custom NaÃ¯ve Bayes Classifier instantly categorizes logs into four severity levels (ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG). This immediate triage is crucial for filtering noise and ensuring the system focuses only on the critical 5%. See the initial output in the ðŸ“Š ML Classification tab.

GenAI Intelligence (Gemini 2.5 Flash): For any critical log (ERROR or WARNING), the system triggers the Gemini 2.5 Flash API. Acting as an "Expert DevOp Assistant," it produces a detailed issue explanation and a clear, three-step remediation playbook ready for deployment. Find the full analysis in the ðŸ’¡ Remediation Plan tab.

Why this matters for engineering teams:

Automation: Reduces manual log investigation time by up to 80%.

Consistency: Provides standardized, expert-level recovery steps every time.

Prototyping: Built using Streamlit with a wide-layout, sidebar, and professional tab navigation, demonstrating the ability to build and deploy complex, full-stack Python solutions.

This project validates the synergy between deterministic ML and contextual GenAI for building truly intelligent systems.
